 <h1> RANSTON</h1>

    <div class="biotext">
     <p> RANSTON is exited to announce the relese of their new EP DENSITY OF BURDEN. A pure rock n roll EP that contains five songs. Each one is unique in its own way, but all of them have that classic rock n roll sound.</p>
     <p> RANSTON is a Stockholm based rock band that plays music that feels right in their soul. A raw guitar sound and some heavy bass lines. A classical piano, and a singer with the voice of a bear from northern Sweden. The band's vision is to revive the glory days of rock, when the music was played with soul and the feeling ov energy set the stage on fire.</p>
     <p> DENSITY OF BURDEN is about the simple hard life that most people have had a taste of at some point. The energy of workers who constantly had a battle to cope with life is felt in the songs. Strongly inspired by stories about how people lived in the past. Stories about people wo were not well off, but still managed to find some enjoyment in their existence.</p>
